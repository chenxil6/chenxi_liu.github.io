I am a senior undergraduate student from the University of Michigan majoring in [Engineering Physics](https://ners.engin.umich.edu/) in the College of Engineering. Right now, I am working with Professor [Hui Deng](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/deng-lab/) in the Physics Department on electron-electron interaction, topological insulators, and correlated magnetic states in Transitional Metal Dichalcogenide (TMD). 

Research Interest
======
My research aims to characterize and engineer the electronic correlated states in the strongly correlated Moir√© system and the exciton-photon strong coupling in the photonic structures. 
In the Moir√© TMD system, we introduce mechanical misalignment of original TMD lattices to form a pattern with period/quasi-period so-called Moir√© supperlattice, which modulates the electron wavefunction through a new-fromed lattice potential called Moir√© potential. We are studying the exotic electronic states and the states with topological protection through the spontaneous breaking of symmetries through the formation of Moir√© brillouin zone.

Similarly, in the photonic crystal, we can find the same analogy for photons, which we trap them as electron in the electronic band to form photon band with a designed energy-momentum distribution in the K-space. We design the photonic bands with nontrivial topological number and strongly couple them to exciton bands to form topological polariton.
