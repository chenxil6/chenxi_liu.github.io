I am a senior undergraduate student from the University of Michigan „ÄΩÔ∏è majoring in [Engineering Physics](https://ners.engin.umich.edu/) in the College of Engineering. Right now, I am working with Professor [Hui Deng](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/deng-lab/) in the Physics Department on quantum many-body physics, topological insulators, and floquet engineering in the low dimensional system. 

Research Interest
======
My research aims to characterize and engineer the electronic correlated states in the strongly correlated Moir√© system and the exciton-photon strong coupling in the photonic structures. 
In the Moir√© TMD system, we introduce mechanical misalignment of original TMD lattices to form a pattern with period/quasi-period so-called Moir√© supperlattice, which modulates the electron wavefunction through a new-fromed Moir√© potential. We are studying the exotic electronic states and the states with topological protection through the spontaneous breaking of symmetries through the formation of Moir√© brillouin zone.

To probe and manipulate the electronic states, we are using electrical methods to dope and apply electric field to the system while using optical methdos to study the change in refraction index and photoluminescence. When the electronic gas reaches certain density, the change in chemical potential does not necessarily further increase the electronic charge density and form the incompressible state in the system. Some of those incompressible states exhibit a strong optical response to the reflectance contrast and change in photoluminescence. 

To study and engineer the incompressible states, we are also using pump-probe spectroscopy to study both the time-dynamics and the introduction of meta-stable states into the system. The strength of the pump-probe spectroscopy allows us to resolve the minimal feature that only exists in the femtosecond scale. With the energy detuning between the excitonic transition and the pump laser, we can study the floquet engineering to the topological insulators and the topological phases existing in the system. 

In the electronic system, we are looking for electronic bands and electronic band topology. Similarly, in the photonic crystal, we can find the same analogy for photons, which we trap them to form photon band with a designed energy-momentum dispersion in the momentum space. We design the photonic bands with nontrivial topological index and strongly couple them to exciton bands to form topological polariton. Those topological polaritons will form topolgical edge states and can be observed one-way transport.
